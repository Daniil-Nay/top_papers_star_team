While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities in closed-world settings, exemplified by standard benchmarks in mathematics and code, they struggle in open-ended and dynamic environments. The emergence of agentic reasoning marks paradigm shift, bridging thought and action by reframing LLMs as autonomous agents that plan, act, and learn through continual interaction. In this survey, we provide systematic roadmap by organizing agentic reasoning along three complementary dimensions. First, we characterize environmental dynamics through three layers: foundational agentic reasoning establishes core single-agent capabilities, including planning, tool use, and search, that operate in stable environments; self-evolving agentic reasoning examines how agents refine these capabilities through feedback, memory, and adaptation in evolving settings; and collective multi-agent reasoning extends intelligence to collaborative scenarios where multiple agents coordinate roles, share knowledge, and pursue shared goals. Across all layers, we analyze system constraints and optimization settings by distinguishing in-context reasoning, which scales test-time interaction through structured orchestration and adaptive workflow design, from posttraining reasoning, which optimizes behaviors through reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning. We further review a"

Current TTS systems typically generate accented speech by conditioning on speaker embeddings associated with specific accents. While effective, this approach offers limited interpretability and controllability, as emIn this beddings also encode traits such as timbre and emotion. study, we analyze the interaction between speaker embeddings and linguistically motivated phonological rules in accented speech synthesis. Using American and British English as case study, we implement rules for flapping, rhoticity, and vowel correspondences. We propose the phoneme shift rate (PSR), novel metric quantifying how strongly embeddings preserve or override rule-based transformations. Experiments show that combining rules with embeddings yields more authentic accents, while embeddings can attenuate or overwrite rules, revealing entanglement between accent and speaker identity. Our findings highlight rules as lever for accent control and framework for evaluating disentanglement in speech generation.

INTRODUCTION Accents are defining source of variation in spoken language, and English provides striking case.

Abstract This work advances autonomous robot exploration by integrating agent-level semantic reasoning with fast local control. We introduce FARE, hierarchical autonomous exploration framework that integrates large language model (LLM) for global reasoning with reinforcement learning (RL) policy for local decision making. FARE follows fast-slow thinking paradigm. The slow-thinking LLM module interprets concise textual description of the unknown environment and synthesizes an agent-level exploration strategy, which is then grounded into sequence of global waypoints through topological graph. To further improve reasoning efficiency, this module employs modularity-based pruning mechanism that reduces redundant graph structures. The fast-thinking RL module executes exploration by reacting to local observations while being guided by the LLM-generated global waypoints. The RL policy is additionally shaped by reward term that encourages adherence to the global waypoints, enabling coherent and robust closed-loop behavior. This architecture decouples semantic reasoning from geometric decision, allowing each module to operate in its appropriate temporal and spatial scale. In challenging simulated environments, our results show that FARE achieves substantial improvements in exploration efficiency over state-of-the-art baselines. We further deploy 1Beihang University, China 2Department of Mechanical Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore FARE on hardware and validate it in complex, 200m 130m building environment. large scale I.

The implementation leverages just-intime (JIT) compilation for computational efficiency while maintaining accessibility for instructional purposes. Validation encompasses progressively complex scenarios including isolated soliton propagation, symmetric two-wave configurations, overtaking collisions between waves of differing amplitudes, and three-body interactions. Conservation of the classical invariants is monitored throughout, with deviations remaining small across all test cases. Measured soliton velocities conform closely to theoretical predictions based on the amplitude-velocity relationship characteristic of integrable systems. Complementary diagnostics drawn from information theory and recurrence analysis confirm that computed solutions preserve the regular phase-space structure expected for completely integrable dynamics.

Agentic reasoning redefines large language models as autonomous agents capable of planning, acting, and learning through continuous interaction in dynamic environments across single-agent and multi-agent frameworks.  					AI-generated summary 				 Reasoning is a fundamental cognitive process underlying inference, problem-solving, and decision-making. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities in closed-world settings, they struggle in open-ended and dynamic environments. Agentic reasoning marks a paradigm shift by reframing LLMs as autonomous agents that plan, act, and learn through continual interaction. In this survey, we organize agentic reasoning along three complementary dimensions. First, we characterize environmental dynamics through three layers: foundational agentic reasoning, which establishes core single-agent capabilities including planning, tool use, and search in stable environments; self-evolving agentic reasoning, which studies how agents refine these capabilities through feedback, memory, and adaptation; and collective multi-agent reasoning, which extends intelligence to collaborative settings involving coordination, knowledge sharing, and shared goals. Across these layers, we distinguish in-context reasoning, which scales test-time interaction through structured orchestration, from post-training reasoning, which optimizes behaviors via reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning. We further review representative agentic reasoning frameworks across real-world applications and benchmarks, including science, robotics, healthcare, autonomous research, and mathematics. This survey synthesizes agentic reasoning methods into a unified roadmap bridging thought and action, and outlines open challenges and future directions, including personalization, long-horizon interaction, world modeling, scalable multi-agent training, and governance for real-world deployment.

A comprehensive robotics benchmark evaluates video generation models across multiple task domains and embodiments, revealing deficiencies in physical realism and introducing a large-scale dataset to address training data shortages.  					AI-generated summary 				 Video generation models have significantly advanced embodied intelligence, unlocking new possibilities for generating diverse robot data that capture perception, reasoning, and action in the physical world. However, synthesizing high-quality videos that accurately reflect real-world robotic interactions remains challenging, and the lack of a standardized benchmark limits fair comparisons and progress. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive robotics benchmark, RBench, designed to evaluate robot-oriented video generation across five task domains and four distinct embodiments. It assesses both task-level correctness and visual fidelity through reproducible sub-metrics, including structural consistency, physical plausibility, and action completeness. Evaluation of 25 representative models highlights significant deficiencies in generating physically realistic robot behaviors. Furthermore, the benchmark achieves a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.96 with human evaluations, validating its effectiveness. While RBench provides the necessary lens to identify these deficiencies, achieving physical realism requires moving beyond evaluation to address the critical shortage of high-quality training data. Driven by these insights, we introduce a refined four-stage data pipeline, resulting in RoVid-X, the largest open-source robotic dataset for video generation with 4 million annotated video clips, covering thousands of tasks and enriched with comprehensive physical property annotations. Collectively, this synergistic ecosystem of evaluation and data establishes a robust foundation for rigorous assessment and scalable training of video models, accelerating the evolution of embodied AI toward general intelligence.

RebuttalAgent is a multi-agent framework that reframes rebuttal generation as an evidence-centric planning task, improving coverage, faithfulness, and strategic coherence in academic peer review.  					AI-generated summary 				 Writing effective rebuttals is a high-stakes task that demands more than linguistic fluency, as it requires precise alignment between reviewer intent and manuscript details. Current solutions typically treat this as a direct-to-text generation problem, suffering from hallucination, overlooked critiques, and a lack of verifiable grounding. To address these limitations, we introduce RebuttalAgent, the first multi-agents framework that reframes rebuttal generation as an evidence-centric planning task. Our system decomposes complex feedback into atomic concerns and dynamically constructs hybrid contexts by synthesizing compressed summaries with high-fidelity text while integrating an autonomous and on-demand external search module to resolve concerns requiring outside literature. By generating an inspectable response plan before drafting, RebuttalAgent ensures that every argument is explicitly anchored in internal or external evidence. We validate our approach on the proposed RebuttalBench and demonstrate that our pipeline outperforms strong baselines in coverage, faithfulness, and strategic coherence, offering a transparent and controllable assistant for the peer review process. Code will be released.

MMDeepResearch-Bench evaluates multimodal research agents on report generation with visual evidence, revealing trade-offs between prose quality, citation accuracy, and visual grounding.  					AI-generated summary 				 Deep Research Agents (DRAs) generate citation-rich reports via multi-step search and synthesis, yet existing benchmarks mainly target text-only settings or short-form multimodal QA, missing end-to-end multimodal evidence use. We introduce MMDeepResearch-Bench (MMDR-Bench), a benchmark of 140 expert-crafted tasks across 21 domains, where each task provides an image-text bundle to evaluate multimodal understanding and citation-grounded report generation. Compared to prior setups, MMDR-Bench emphasizes report-style synthesis with explicit evidence use, where models must connect visual artifacts to sourced claims and maintain consistency across narrative, citations, and visual references. We further propose a unified, interpretable evaluation pipeline: Formula-LLM Adaptive Evaluation (FLAE) for report quality, Trustworthy Retrieval-Aligned Citation Evaluation (TRACE) for citation-grounded evidence alignment, and Multimodal Support-Aligned Integrity Check (MOSAIC) for text-visual integrity, each producing fine-grained signals that support error diagnosis beyond a single overall score. Experiments across 25 state-of-the-art models reveal systematic trade-offs between generation quality, citation discipline, and multimodal grounding, highlighting that strong prose alone does not guarantee faithful evidence use and that multimodal integrity remains a key bottleneck for deep research agents.

FinVault presents the first execution-grounded security benchmark for financial agents, revealing significant vulnerabilities in current defense mechanisms when applied to real-world financial workflows.  					AI-generated summary 				 Financial agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for investment analysis, risk assessment, and automated decision-making, where their abilities to plan, invoke tools, and manipulate mutable state introduce new security risks in high-stakes and highly regulated financial environments. However, existing safety evaluations largely focus on language-model-level content compliance or abstract agent settings, failing to capture execution-grounded risks arising from real operational workflows and state-changing actions. To bridge this gap, we propose FinVault, the first execution-grounded security benchmark for financial agents, comprising 31 regulatory case-driven sandbox scenarios with state-writable databases and explicit compliance constraints, together with 107 real-world vulnerabilities and 963 test cases that systematically cover prompt injection, jailbreaking, financially adapted attacks, as well as benign inputs for false-positive evaluation. Experimental results reveal that existing defense mechanisms remain ineffective in realistic financial agent settings, with average attack success rates (ASR) still reaching up to 50.0\% on state-of-the-art models and remaining non-negligible even for the most robust systems (ASR 6.7\%), highlighting the limited transferability of current safety designs and the need for stronger financial-specific defenses. Our code can be found at https://github.com/aifinlab/FinVault.

Render-of-Thought framework converts textual reasoning steps into images using vision-language models to improve reasoning traceability and efficiency while maintaining competitive performance.  					AI-generated summary 				 Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has achieved remarkable success in unlocking the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Although CoT prompting enhances reasoning, its verbosity imposes substantial computational overhead. Recent works often focus exclusively on outcome alignment and lack supervision on the intermediate reasoning process. These deficiencies obscure the analyzability of the latent reasoning chain. To address these challenges, we introduce Render-of-Thought (RoT), the first framework to reify the reasoning chain by rendering textual steps into images, making the latent rationale explicit and traceable. Specifically, we leverage the vision encoders of existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) as semantic anchors to align the vision embeddings with the textual space. This design ensures plug-and-play implementation without incurring additional pre-training overhead. Extensive experiments on mathematical and logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression and substantial inference acceleration compared to explicit CoT. Furthermore, it maintains competitive performance against other methods, validating the feasibility of this paradigm. Our code is available at https://github.com/TencentBAC/RoT

Thai-focused vision-language model for document extraction combining OCR, layout reconstruction, and structural consistency with reduced computational requirements.  					AI-generated summary 				 Document extraction is a core component of digital workflows, yet existing vision-language models (VLMs) predominantly favor high-resource languages. Thai presents additional challenges due to script complexity from non-latin letters, the absence of explicit word boundaries, and the prevalence of highly unstructured real-world documents, limiting the effectiveness of current open-source models. This paper presents Typhoon OCR, an open VLM for document extraction tailored for Thai and English. The model is fine-tuned from vision-language backbones using a Thai-focused training dataset. The dataset is developed using a multi-stage data construction pipeline that combines traditional OCR, VLM-based restructuring, and curated synthetic data. Typhoon OCR is a unified framework capable of text transcription, layout reconstruction, and document-level structural consistency. The latest iteration of our model, Typhoon OCR V1.5, is a compact and inference-efficient model designed to reduce reliance on metadata and simplify deployment. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse Thai document categories, including financial reports, government forms, books, infographics, and handwritten documents, show that Typhoon OCR achieves performance comparable to or exceeding larger frontier proprietary models, despite substantially lower computational cost. The results demonstrate that open vision-language OCR models can achieve accurate text extraction and layout reconstruction for Thai documents, reaching performance comparable to proprietary systems while remaining lightweight and deployable.

A multi-agent framework for compositional image retrieval that uses specialized agents for generation, filtering, and verification to improve semantic and visual query matching.  					AI-generated summary 				 Retrieval is being redefined by agentic AI, demanding multimodal reasoning beyond conventional similarity-based paradigms. Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) exemplifies this shift as each query combines a reference image with textual modifications, requiring compositional understanding across modalities. While embedding-based CIR methods have achieved progress, they remain narrow in perspective, capturing limited cross-modal cues and lacking semantic reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce XR, a training-free multi-agent framework that reframes retrieval as a progressively coordinated reasoning process. It orchestrates three specialized types of agents: imagination agents synthesize target representations through cross-modal generation, similarity agents perform coarse filtering via hybrid matching, and question agents verify factual consistency through targeted reasoning for fine filtering. Through progressive multi-agent coordination, XR iteratively refines retrieval to meet both semantic and visual query constraints, achieving up to a 38% gain over strong training-free and training-based baselines on FashionIQ, CIRR, and CIRCO, while ablations show each agent is essential.

Research reveals that causal attention in language models creates information bottlenecks when question-answer options follow context, leading to performance drops of over 14 percentage points compared to reversed prompt ordering.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large language models exhibit surprising sensitivity to the structure of the prompt, but the mechanisms underlying this sensitivity remain poorly understood. In this work, we conduct an in-depth investigation on a striking case: in multiple-choice question answering, placing context before the questions and options (CQO) outperforms the reverse order (QOC) by over 14%p, consistently over a wide range of models and datasets. Through systematic architectural analysis, we identify causal attention as the core mechanism: in QOC prompts, the causal mask prevents option tokens from attending to context, creating an information bottleneck where context becomes invisible to options.

Research investigates the relationship between speaker embeddings and phonological rules in accent control for text-to-speech systems, introducing a metric to measure rule preservation versus embedding influence.  					AI-generated summary 				 Many spoken languages, including English, exhibit wide variation in dialects and accents, making accent control an important capability for flexible text-to-speech (TTS) models. Current TTS systems typically generate accented speech by conditioning on speaker embeddings associated with specific accents. While effective, this approach offers limited interpretability and controllability, as embeddings also encode traits such as timbre and emotion. In this study, we analyze the interaction between speaker embeddings and linguistically motivated phonological rules in accented speech synthesis. Using American and British English as a case study, we implement rules for flapping, rhoticity, and vowel correspondences. We propose the phoneme shift rate (PSR), a novel metric quantifying how strongly embeddings preserve or override rule-based transformations. Experiments show that combining rules with embeddings yields more authentic accents, while embeddings can attenuate or overwrite rules, revealing entanglement between accent and speaker identity. Our findings highlight rules as a lever for accent control and a framework for evaluating disentanglement in speech generation.

RoboBrain 2.5 enhances embodied AI through improved 3D spatial reasoning and temporal value estimation for more precise manipulation tasks.  					AI-generated summary 				 We introduce RoboBrain 2.5, a next-generation embodied AI foundation model that advances general perception, spatial reasoning, and temporal modeling through extensive training on high-quality spatiotemporal supervision. Building upon its predecessor, RoboBrain 2.5 introduces two major capability upgrades. Specifically, it unlocks Precise 3D Spatial Reasoning by shifting from 2D pixel-relative grounding to depth-aware coordinate prediction and absolute metric constraint comprehension, generating complete 3D manipulation traces as ordered keypoint sequences under physical constraints. Complementing this spatial precision, the model establishes Dense Temporal Value Estimation that provides dense, step-aware progress prediction and execution state understanding across varying viewpoints, producing stable feedback signals for downstream learning. Together, these upgrades extend the framework toward more physically grounded and execution-aware embodied intelligence for complex, fine-grained manipulation. The code and checkpoints are available at project website: https://superrobobrain.github.io

A general coding agent paradigm enables flexible formal theorem proving by directly interfacing with proof assistants and retrieving relevant theorems without task-specific training.  					AI-generated summary 				 Agentic systems have recently become the dominant paradigm for formal theorem proving, achieving strong performance by coordinating multiple models and tools. However, existing approaches often rely on task-specific pipelines and trained formal provers, limiting their flexibility and reproducibility. In this paper, we propose the paradigm that directly uses a general coding agent as a formal math reasoner. This paradigm is motivated by (1) A general coding agent provides a natural interface for diverse reasoning tasks beyond proving, (2) Performance can be improved by simply replacing the underlying base model, without training, and (3) MCP enables flexible extension and autonomous calling of specialized tools, avoiding complex design. Based on this paradigm, we introduce Numina-Lean-Agent, which combines Claude Code with Numina-Lean-MCP to enable autonomous interaction with Lean, retrieval of relevant theorems, informal proving and auxiliary reasoning tools. Using Claude Opus 4.5 as the base model, Numina-Lean-Agent solves all problems in Putnam 2025 (12 / 12), matching the best closed-source system. Beyond benchmark evaluation, we further demonstrate its generality by interacting with mathematicians to successfully formalize the Brascamp-Lieb theorem. We release Numina-Lean-Agent and all solutions at https://github.com/project-numina/numina-lean-agent.

AgentEHR presents a benchmark for autonomous EHR navigation requiring complex decision-making, while RetroSum framework improves performance through retrospective summarization and evolving experience strategies.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large Language Models have demonstrated profound utility in the medical domain. However, their application to autonomous Electronic Health Records~(EHRs) navigation remains constrained by a reliance on curated inputs and simplified retrieval tasks. To bridge the gap between idealized experimental settings and realistic clinical environments, we present AgentEHR. This benchmark challenges agents to execute complex decision-making tasks, such as diagnosis and treatment planning, requiring long-range interactive reasoning directly within raw and high-noise databases. In tackling these tasks, we identify that existing summarization methods inevitably suffer from critical information loss and fractured reasoning continuity. To address this, we propose RetroSum, a novel framework that unifies a retrospective summarization mechanism with an evolving experience strategy. By dynamically re-evaluating interaction history, the retrospective mechanism prevents long-context information loss and ensures unbroken logical coherence. Additionally, the evolving strategy bridges the domain gap by retrieving accumulated experience from a memory bank. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that RetroSum achieves performance gains of up to 29.16% over competitive baselines, while significantly decreasing total interaction errors by up to 92.3%.

A 115M-parameter FastConformer-Transducer model achieves low-latency Thai speech recognition with reduced computational cost through text normalization and curriculum learning, accompanied by a benchmark dataset for standardized evaluation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Large encoder-decoder models like Whisper achieve strong offline transcription but remain impractical for streaming applications due to high latency. However, due to the accessibility of pre-trained checkpoints, the open Thai ASR landscape remains dominated by these offline architectures, leaving a critical gap in efficient streaming solutions. We present Typhoon ASR Real-time, a 115M-parameter FastConformer-Transducer model for low-latency Thai speech recognition. We demonstrate that rigorous text normalization can match the impact of model scaling: our compact model achieves a 45x reduction in computational cost compared to Whisper Large-v3 while delivering comparable accuracy. Our normalization pipeline resolves systemic ambiguities in Thai transcription --including context-dependent number verbalization and repetition markers (mai yamok) --creating consistent training targets. We further introduce a two-stage curriculum learning approach for Isan (north-eastern) dialect adaptation that preserves Central Thai performance. To address reproducibility challenges in Thai ASR, we release the Typhoon ASR Benchmark, a gold-standard human-labeled datasets with transcriptions following established Thai linguistic conventions, providing standardized evaluation protocols for the research community.

Modern CI/CD pipelines integrating agent-generated code exhibit a structural failure in responsibility attribution. Decisions are executed through formally correct approval processes, yet no entity possesses both the authority to approve those decisions and the epistemic capacity to meaningfully understand their basis.   We define this condition as responsibility vacuum: a state in which decisions occur, but responsibility cannot be attributed because authority and verification capacity do not coincide. We show that this is not a process deviation or technical defect, but a structural property of deployments where decision generation throughput exceeds bounded human verification capacity.   We identify a scaling limit under standard deployment assumptions, including parallel agent generation, CI-based validation, and individualized human approval gates. Beyond a throughput threshold, verification ceases to function as a decision criterion and is replaced by ritualized approval based on proxy signals. Personalized responsibility becomes structurally unattainable in this regime.   We further characterize a CI amplification dynamic, whereby increasing automated validation coverage raises proxy signal density without restoring human capacity. Under fixed time and attention constraints, this accelerates cognitive offloading in the broad sense and widens the gap between formal approval and epistemic understanding. Additional automation therefore amplifies, rather than mitigates, the responsibility vacuum.   We conclude that unless organizations explicitly redesign decision boundaries or reassign responsibility away from individual decisions toward batch- or system-level ownership, responsibility vacuum remains an invisible but persistent failure mode in scaled agent deployments.

WebSeek is a mixed-initiative browser extension that enables interactive web data extraction and analysis with AI-assisted guidance and automation.  					AI-generated summary 				 Web AI agents such as ChatGPT Agent and GenSpark are increasingly used for routine web-based tasks, yet they still rely on text-based input prompts, lack proactive detection of user intent, and offer no support for interactive data analysis and decision making. We present WebSeek, a mixed-initiative browser extension that enables users to discover and extract information from webpages to then flexibly build, transform, and refine tangible data artifacts-such as tables, lists, and visualizations-all within an interactive canvas. Within this environment, users can perform analysis-including data transformations such as joining tables or creating visualizations-while an in-built AI both proactively offers context-aware guidance and automation, and reactively responds to explicit user requests. An exploratory user study (N=15) with WebSeek as a probe reveals participants' diverse analysis strategies, underscoring their desire for transparency and control during human-AI collaboration.

FARE is a hierarchical exploration framework that combines large language model reasoning with reinforcement learning control to enable efficient autonomous robot navigation in complex environments.  					AI-generated summary 				 This work advances autonomous robot exploration by integrating agent-level semantic reasoning with fast local control. We introduce FARE, a hierarchical autonomous exploration framework that integrates a large language model (LLM) for global reasoning with a reinforcement learning (RL) policy for local decision making. FARE follows a fast-slow thinking paradigm. The slow-thinking LLM module interprets a concise textual description of the unknown environment and synthesizes an agent-level exploration strategy, which is then grounded into a sequence of global waypoints through a topological graph. To further improve reasoning efficiency, this module employs a modularity-based pruning mechanism that reduces redundant graph structures. The fast-thinking RL module executes exploration by reacting to local observations while being guided by the LLM-generated global waypoints. The RL policy is additionally shaped by a reward term that encourages adherence to the global waypoints, enabling coherent and robust closed-loop behavior. This architecture decouples semantic reasoning from geometric decision, allowing each module to operate in its appropriate temporal and spatial scale. In challenging simulated environments, our results show that FARE achieves substantial improvements in exploration efficiency over state-of-the-art baselines. We further deploy FARE on hardware and validate it in complex, large scale 200mtimes130m building environment.

The Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation serves as a foundational model in nonlinear wave physics, describing the balance between dispersive spreading and nonlinear steepening that gives rise to solitons. This article introduces sangkuriang, an open-source Python library for solving this equation using Fourier pseudo-spectral spatial discretization coupled with adaptive high-order time integration. The implementation leverages just-in-time (JIT) compilation for computational efficiency while maintaining accessibility for instructional purposes. Validation encompasses progressively complex scenarios including isolated soliton propagation, symmetric two-wave configurations, overtaking collisions between waves of differing amplitudes, and three-body interactions. Conservation of the classical invariants is monitored throughout, with deviations remaining small across all test cases. Measured soliton velocities conform closely to theoretical predictions based on the amplitude-velocity relationship characteristic of integrable systems. Complementary diagnostics drawn from information theory and recurrence analysis confirm that computed solutions preserve the regular phase-space structure expected for completely integrable dynamics. The solver outputs data in standard scientific formats compatible with common analysis tools and generates visualizations of spatiotemporal wave evolution. By combining numerical accuracy with practical accessibility on modest computational resources, sangkuriang offers a platform suitable for both classroom demonstrations of nonlinear wave phenomena and exploratory research into soliton dynamics.
